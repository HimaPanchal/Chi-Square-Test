# Project Overview

Project Details from Data Scientist's Email

Earlier this year, our client, a grocery retailer, launched a campaign for their new “Delivery Club.” This club costs $100 per year and offers free grocery deliveries, compared to the usual $10 per delivery.

For the campaign, customers were randomly divided into three groups:

The first group received a low-cost, basic mailer.
The second group received a high-cost, premium mailer.
The third group, the control group, received no mailer.
The client has observed that customers who received a mailer signed up for the Delivery Club at a much higher rate than those in the control group. Now, they would like to understand if there’s a significant difference in sign-up rates between the low-cost and high-cost mailers. This analysis will help them optimize campaign ROI in the future.
